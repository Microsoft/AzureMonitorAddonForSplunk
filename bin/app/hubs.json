    -- Add to this file only references to hubs that actually exist in your hub namespace.
    --
    -- Each reference looks like this: "hub-name": "resourceId"
    -- The only exception is "insights-logs-workflowruntime": "workflowId"
    --  which you would need if you're monitoring the Workflow Runtime.
    -- And of course, you need a valid json file as the result. So put a comma at the end of each line except the last.
    -- 
    -- Example: you monitor load balancer health probe status logs. You would add this line to hubs.json:
    --  "insights-logs-loadbalancerprobehealthstatus": "resourceId"
    -- UNLESS you decided to name your own hub. In which case you would add that name in place of the default above.
    --
    -- SPECIAL NOTE:
    -- Under no circumstances should "insights-operational-logs" be in this file. This is the non-configurable
    --  hub name assigned to Azure Monitor Activity Logs.
